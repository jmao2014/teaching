The X-ray Universe
=====================================

.. highlight:: none

Black holes, stars, and galaxies are not isolated "islands" in the Universe.
Their formation and evolution are governed by the rich dynamics of
surrounding materials. For instance, to explain many key
observable properties of galaxies, feedback from their member stars and
supermassive black holes are required. However, the details of how does
it work and when does it occur remain uncertain
from both an observational and theoretical perspectives.

About half of the baryonic matter in the entire Universe is expected to be
in the form of diffuse hot plasmas with a temperature up to billions of
degrees. Since the hot plasmas shine in the X-ray wavelength range
(0.1-100 Ã…), X-ray spectroscopy is thus one of the main techniques
to reveal their nature. Plasma diagnostics can quantify the
physical properties (temperature, density, chemical composition,
microscopic turbulence, line of sight velocity, etc.) of the observing targets.
Such valuable information is essential to understand the complex interplay
that connects those seemingly isolated "islands" in the Universe.

High-quality X-ray spectra collected by the current and future missions
also challenge plasma models widely used in the community.
This requires the continuous development of plasma codes.

.. topic:: Assignment

  - There are a few X-ray space observatories launched since 1999, including
    `NASA's Chandra space observatory
    <https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html>`_.
    Write a few sentences about Chandra and 2 to 4 other similar X-ray space
    observatories.
