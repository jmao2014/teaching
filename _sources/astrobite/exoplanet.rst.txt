Astrobite collection on exoplanets
=========================================

.. highlight:: none

An exoplanet is a planet outside the Solar System. To find lives outside
our solar system, we need to first find exoplanets that are habitable to life.
On 6 October 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva
announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting a
main-sequence star, nearby G-type star 51 Pegasi. This discovery, made at the
Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary
discovery, and was recognized by a share of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics.
