Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH)
=========================================

.. highlight:: none

Two types of black holes are often observed in the Universe: supermassive
black holes and stellar-mass black holes. The former typically has a mass
of at least a few hundreds of thousands that of the Sun. The latter typically
has a mass of up to a few tens that of the Sun. This leaves an observational
gap of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH). The formation and evolution of
supermassive black hole is an open question in astronomy. One of the possible
way to grow a supermassive black hole is through merging of less massive
black holes. This is challenged by the lack of IMBH out there in the Universe.
Therefore, hunting for the "missing" IMBH is a hot topic.

Q1: The caption of Fig. 1 says Gal 1 is rich in minor mergers, and Gal 2 is
likely connected with Gal 1 through a tidal stream. According to Fig. 1,

- Gal 2 is about to collide with Gal 1
- Gal 2 has just passed through Gal 1

Answer: Gal 2 has just passed through Gal 1


Q2: According to the timeline, an X-ray outburst was observed in 2006. The
X-ray flux was much lower in 2014 -- 2016. What if we had X-ray observations
in 2004, what is your expectation of the X-ray flux?


Q3: In Fig. 2, there is a third galaxy, Gal 3. What do you think we need to
measure in order to know that whether Gal 3 is also connected with Gal 1?

Answer: If the redshifts of Gal 1 and Gal 3 are close, it is more likely
they are connected. If the redshifts differ significantly, they should not
be connected.
