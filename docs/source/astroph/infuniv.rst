The infinite Universe
=====================================

.. highlight:: none

It takes about 3 days for a spacecraft to reach the moon. If we can
travel at the speed of light, it would take 1.28194 (light-)second to reach the
moon. It takes about 8 light-minutes to reach the Sun.

Voyager 1 is a space probe that was launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. It
is the most distance human-made object from our mother planet. Its distance to
the Sun is currently about 149 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
One can track the distance of Voyager 1 live `here

It takes about 4.25 light-years to reach the closet star to our own --
Proxima Centauri. Even if we can travel at the speed about 1%
of the speed of light, it would still take about 425 years for the interstellar
travel to meet the closest known planet to the Solar System --
`Proxima Centauri b

The record for the fastest human-made object is recently set by NASA's
`Parker Solar Probe <https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe>`_,
with a speed of about 200000 meter per second (about 16 times slower than
1% of the speed of light).

The size of the Milky Way is about 100000 light-years across. There are about
100 to 400 billions stars and at least that many planets in the Milky Way.

Well, that is still a teeny-tiny tip of the iceberg. Check out this video
