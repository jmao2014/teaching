Astrobites
=========================

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Astronomy is a rapidly evolving subject. It is also a cross-disciplinary
subject that links to many other subjects like chemistry, atomic physics,
statistics, computer science, and so forth.

While textbooks also play an important role in the process of teaching and
learning, they do not encompass the most recent research results.
Incorporating current research into teaching and learning is useful to (1)
prepare students to engage in scientific research and
(2) to prepare students for careers that leverage skillsets similar to
those used by research scientists (Sanders et al. 2017,
`American Journal of Physics, 85, 741 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01165>`_).

Current researches are needless to say published in peer-reviewed journals.
Reading a journal publication of an unfamiliar topic can be intimidating.
In particular, for physics students with rather limited exposure to astronomy,
the entire field is new to them. An Astrobite is a digest of a recent
journal publication in astronomy. It is a 10-min read accessible to
undergraduate students interested in the (astro)physical sciences.
It should use the least amount of obscure jargon to summarize the
techniques and findings of the paper in the context of addressing
bigger questions motivating the field.

Here, you are asked to read Astrobites and answer some questions via google
form (see an example below). A list of Astrobites (with due dates) will be
provide in the Astrobites channel on Slack.

Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- `Astrobites: The starry, dusty origin of a galaxy cluster at z = 4!
  <https:>`_
- `google form <>`_

In the google form, you should find four questions related to
the starry, dusty origin of the distant galaxy cluster.

Question #1
""""""""""""""""""""""""
According to the hierarchical structure formation model of the Universe,
between a protocluster at z = 3 and a nearby cluster at z = 0.5, it is very
likely that the protocluster has

- more elliptical galaxies
- more star forming galaxies

Answer: More star forming galaxies.

Question #2
""""""""""""""""""""""""
When computing the total mass of the protocluster, how many DSFGs should
we include? Please also explain a bit why.

Answer: 11 (if we count all the ) or 10 (if we exclude DSFG 5).

Question #3 (open question)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
What do you think can be an alternative to the hierarchical structure
formation model of the Universe?

Answer: Large structures are born bigger.
